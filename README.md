tictactoe
=========

This is a simple JS and jQuery game of tic tac toe I created to practice my javascript skils. It works well enough at the moment, but I will like to eventually improve the game in a few ways:

- Make the compuer (playing as O) smarter. At the moment the computer randomly chooses a square to play, not trying to get a win.
- Add a win counter
- Allow player to choose whether to play as X or O
